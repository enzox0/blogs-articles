## Becoming a Good Software Developer

Great developers are not defined by the number of languages they know but by the way they approach problems, people, and learning. Build habits that compound over years, not hacks that only get you through the next sprint.

### Mindset and Mastery
1. **Stay curious** – treat every bug or code review as a chance to learn something you didn’t know yesterday.
2. **Embrace discomfort** – choose tasks that scare you a little; deliberate practice lives right past your comfort zone.
3. **Maintain a learning backlog** – capture topics, tools, or papers you want to explore so curiosity turns into a steady diet of growth.

### Building and Shipping
4. **Ship, then sharpen** – focus on delivering working software, then iterate to improve architecture, tests, and polish.
5. **Make decisions visible** – document trade-offs, constraints, and rejected options so future you (and teammates) understand the context.
6. **Automate the boring** – scripts, templates, and linting free up attention for design choices that actually matter.

### Collaborative Excellence
7. **Go beyond code** – understand the product, users, and business context so your technical decisions solve real problems.
8. **Practice deliberate communication** – write clear PR descriptions, docs, and async updates; talk through trade-offs early.
9. **Teach and be teachable** – share what you know, ask for feedback often, and accept it without ego.

### Sustaining the Journey
10. **Protect focus** – block deep-work time, say no to scope creep, and automate repetitive chores to keep cognitive load manageable.
11. **Design recovery rituals** – postmortems, retros, and even journaling prevent hard weeks from turning into burnout.
12. **Curate your environment** – surround yourself with peers, mentors, and communities that challenge your assumptions.
